{{/MAT}}

## Directions
In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs, chiles, and salt.

Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, spray with olive oil, and add
the eggs. Let the eggs set on the bottom, then stir a few times until drained
scrambled and cooked through, about 3 minutes. Transter to a plate and set
aside. Wipe the skillet clean.

Reheat the skillet over medium-high heat and spray with oil once it is really
hot. Place a tortilla in the skillet and mound &frac13; cup cheese on the lower
half, leaving about 1 inch around the edge. Top with one-fourth of the eggs,
cilantro, and red onion, then fold in half. Cook until the cheese is melted
through and the tortilla is golden on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes. Set aside and
repeat with the remaining 3 tortillas. Cut each into wedges. Serve hot with
salsa and avocado.

**MEAL PREP:** Place the quesadillas and salsa into separate airtight containers
and store in the fridge. When ready to eat, serve at room temperature or reheat
(see Skinny Scoop). Add the avocado the morning you plan on eating the
quesadillas to avoid browning

**SKINNY SCOOP:** Quesadillas are some of my favorite things to meal prep, but I
don't recommend reheating them in the microwave, or they'll get soggy. Instead,
I eat them at room temperature if I've packed them to take with me, or if I'm
home I reheat them on a skillet or in my air fryer.

For recipes with avocado for meal prep, it's best to cut the avocado the morning
you are going to eat it and wrap the rest tightly with plastic wrap. squeeze of
lime juice on the avocado will help prevent it from browning.
