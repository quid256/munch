# Breakfast Banana Oatmeal Smoothie
From BWS. A good way to get lots of calories with relatively little effort.

**Makes:** 1 smoothie

## Ingredients
{{#MAT servings=1}}
1 banana // frozen
1 tbsp peanut butter
1/3 cup ground oatmeal
1 scoop protein powder

2 cups milk
{{/MAT}}

## Directions
Blend banana with a smaller amount of milk until creamy. Add the rest of the
milk, peanut butter, ground oatmeal, and protein powder. Blend until smooth

**Modifications**: Good with frozen blueberries. I may explore the nutrition of
other substitutions (e.g. yogurt for pb, other berries) in the future.
