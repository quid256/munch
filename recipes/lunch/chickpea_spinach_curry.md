{{/MAT}}

## Directions
Heat the oil in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, cumin,
turmeric, curry powder, chili powder, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook for 4 to 5
minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onion is soft and golden. Add the
ginger and garlic and cook for 1 to 2 minutes more, until fragrant.

Add the tomatoes, chickpeas, and 1/4 cup water and stir. Cook uncovered, stirring
occasionally, for about 5 minutes, to let the flavors meld. Stir in the spinach,
coconut milk, and remaining salt, and stir over medium-low heat until the
spinach wilts, about 2 minutes.

**SERVE NOW**: Place 1 cup curry in each shallow bowl and rice alongside.

**FREEZE & SERVE LATER**: Make the curry without the coconut milk and transfer
to a large freezer-safe container or 4 smaller containers. To reheat, thaw the
curry overnight in the refrigerator, then heat on the stove in a saucepan,
stirring in the coconut milk.
