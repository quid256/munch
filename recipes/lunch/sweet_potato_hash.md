# Sweet Potato Hash
From Built With Science. Pretty good tasting, though. Doesn't keep the best, but
tastes fine the next day; Might be nicer to prep all the ingredients and cook
the day of.

**Makes:** 1 serving

## Ingredients
{{#MAT servings=1}}
1/2 bell pepper // chopped
1/4 white onion // chopped
120g uncooked sweet potato // peeled + cubed
100g black beans
1 boneless skinless chicken breast // cubed, alt sausage
spices
{{/MAT}}

## Directions
Steam the sweet potato cubes in the microwave. While that's going, cook the
chicken somewhat (after applying spices) and remove. Saute onion and bell
pepper. After onions begin to brown, add beans, and sweet potato. Make sure
enough oil has been added so that the resulting mixture will not stick to the
pan. Push into a flat layer and let the potato and chicken brown, agitating
several times to get even browning.
