## Directions
*Make the chicken*: In a slow cooker, combine the beans and tomatoes with chilies.
In a medium bowl, season the chicken with the salt, cumin, garlic powder, and
cayenne. Place the chicken over the beans in the slow cooker and top with the
salsa. Cover and cook on low for about 4 hours, or until the chicken is tender.
In the slow cooker, shred the chicken with two forks and mix well with the sauce
to let the flavors combine. Pour the chicken mixture into a large colander to
drain (you don't want any liquid) and return to the slow cooker. Mix in the rice
and cilantro.

*Assemble the burritos*: On a hot griddle or over an open 
char both  sides of the tortillas (Keep them warm under a towel covering if
eating right away.)

On a clean work surface, spread out the tortilla and scoop 1/2 cup of the
chicken and bean mixture onto the center of each. Top each with 2 tablespoons
cheese. To assemble, roll a tortilla from the bottom up and fold the left and
right edges in toward the center. Continue rolling into a tight cylinder. Repeat
with the remaining tortillas and filling.

**SERVE NOW**: Heat a skillet over medium heat. When hot, spray the skillet with oil
and add the burritos, seam side down. Cook, covered, until the bottom of the
burritos are golden brown, about 3 minutes on each side. Serve with hot sauce,
salsa, and a other optional toppings.

**FREEZE AND SERVE LATER**: After assembling the burritos, place a piece of foil
vertically, then place a burrito at the bottom center. Fold the sides of the
foil over the burrito and roll it up. Transfer to a labeled freezer-safe bag to
prevent freezer burn.
