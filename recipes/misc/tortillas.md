## Ingredients
{{#MAT servings=10}}
3 cups all-purpose flour // can partially sub whole wheat flour
1 tsp salt
1 tsp baking powder
1/3 cup vegatable oil
1 cup warm water
{{/MAT}}


## Directions
1. Combine flour, salt and baking powder in medium to large bowl. Use a silicone
   spatula to combine
1. Make a well and add oil and water. Stir from the bottom until everything is
   incorporated. Dough should still be a bit shaggy.
1. Turn the dough out onto a slightly floured work surface and knead for 1-2 to
   minutes, or until the dough is smooth. It should still look slightly wet and
   feel moist to the touch; add more water or oil if this isn't the case
1. Return the dough to the bowl and cover. Let it sit for at least 15 minutes,
   but no more than 2 hours
1. Begin heating the tortilla press. Divide the dough into pieces (roughly
   70-ish grams (?) for 10" tortillas). Once the press is heated, add the balls
   of dough to the press one at a time.
   - Press quickly and hard enough to stretch the entire tortilla out
   - Try to avoid over-pressing, as this can make the tortillas thin and dry.
     You only want to start cooking them, not finish.
1. After a quick press, take them out. You can now freeze them for preparation
   later, or finish cooking them on pan on the stove for prep now.
