## Directions
In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and season with salt.

Heat a large nonstick skillet over high. When hot, coat with the cooking spray, add the eggs,
and quickly scramble for 1 to 2 minutes. When the eggs are cooked through, remove them from the
pan and set aside.

Add the bacon and cook until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Then use a slotted spoon to transfer
the bacon onto a paper towel. Leave 1 teaspoon of bacon fat in the pan, then add the scallion
whites and cook for 30 to 60 seconds. Add the riced cauliflower and cook until soft, about 5
minutes.

Add the rice and soy sauce and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until heated
through. Return the egg and bacon to the pan and toss with the sesame oil, Sriracha, and
scallion greens.

**Meal Prep:** Divide the rice among 4 airtight containers, about 1 1/4 cups
each. To reheat from the fridge, microwave the rice in 30-second intervals until heated through.
To reheat from frozen, transfer the rice to the refrigerator to thaw, or reheat in the microwave
