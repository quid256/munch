        <h1>SkinnyTaste Breakfast Fried Rice</h1>

        <p>Suggested usage is as a breakfast food.</p>

        <strong>Makes:</strong> 4 servings, each roughly 1&frac14; cup
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 eggs</li>
            <li>&frac18; tsp kosher salt</li>
            <li>cooking spray</li>
            <li>4 slices of bacon</li>
            <li>8 scallions</li>
            <li>2 cups riced cauliflower</li>
            <li>2 cups brown rice</li>
            <li>3 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 tsp Sriracha sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and season with salt.</p>
        <p>Heat a large nonstick skillet over high. When hot, coat with the cooking spray, add the eggs,
        and quickly scramble for 1 to 2 minutes. When the eggs are cooked through, remove them from the
        pan and set aside.</p>
        <p>Add the bacon and cook until browned, 4 to 5 minutes. Then use a slotted spoon to transfer
        the bacon onto a paper towel. Leave 1 teaspoon of bacon fat in the pan, then add the scallion
        whites and cook for 30 to 60 seconds. Add the riced cauliflower and cook until soft, about 5
        minutes.</p>
        <p>Add the rice and soy sauce and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until heated
        through. Return the egg and bacon to the pan and toss with the sesame oil, Sriracha, and
        scallion greens.</p>
        <p><strong>Meal Prep:</strong> Divide the rice among 4 airtight containers, about 1 1/4 cups
        each. To reheat from the fridge, microwave the rice in 30-second intervals until heated through.
        To reheat from frozen, transfer the rice to the refrigerator to thaw, or reheat in the microwave
        from frozen in 30-second intervals until heated through.</p>
